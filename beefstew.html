        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This delicious recipe is super savory and pairs well with a glass of red wine!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 pounds boneless beef chuck (well-marbled), cut into chunks</li>
            <li>2 whole yellow onions</li>
            <li>7 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed</li>
            <li>4 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks on a diagonal</li>
            <li>3 large russet potatoes, sliced into quarters</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of black pepper</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil/li>
            <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>2 cups of water</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of flour</li>
            <li>2 cups dry red wine</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar (optional)</li>
            <li>Fresh chopped parsley, for serving (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325Â°F and set a rack in the lower middle position.</li>
            <li>Pat the beef dry and season with the salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven or heavy soup pot, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium-high heat until hot and shimmering. Brown the meat in 3 batches, turning with tongs, for about 5 minutes per batch; add one tablespoon more oil for each batch. (To sear the meat properly, do not crowd the pan and let the meat develop a nice brown crust before turning with tongs.) Transfer the meat to a large plate and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add the onions, garlic and balsamic vinegar; cook, stirring with a wooden spoon and scraping the brown bits from bottom of the pan, for about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook for a minute more. Add the beef with its juices back to the pan and sprinkle with the flour. Stir with wooden spoon until the flour is dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the wine, beef broth, water, bay leaf, thyme, and sugar. Stir with a wooden spoon to loosen any brown bits from the bottom of the pan and bring to a boil. Cover the pot with a lid, transfer to the preheated oven, and braise for 2 hours.</li>
        </ol>
